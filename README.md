# GraphViz

![CI][ci badge]
[![Documentation][documentation badge]][documentation]

A Swift package for working with [GraphViz][graphviz].

## Requirements

- Swift 5.2+
- GraphViz _(only for rendering)_

## Usage

```swift
import GraphViz
import DOT

var graph = Graph(directed: true)

let a = Node("a"), b = Node("b"), c = Node("c")

graph.append(Edge(from: a, to: b))
graph.append(Edge(from: a, to: c))

var b_c = Edge(from: b, to: c)
b_c.constraint = false
graph.append(b_c)

// Render image using dot layout algorithm
let data = try! Renderer(using: .dot, to: .svg).render(graph: graph)
let svg = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)!
```

```dot
digraph {
  a -> b
  a -> c
  b -> c [constraint=false]
}
```

> **Note**:
> The `render(using:to:)` method requires that
> the GraphViz binary corresponding to the specified layout algorithm
> is accessible from the current `$PATH`.

### Using Function Builders, Custom Operators, and Fluent Attribute Setters

To use the following interface,
add "GraphVizBuilder" to your package's dependencies
and replace `import GraphViz` with `import GraphVizBuilder` as needed.

```swift
import GraphVizBuilder

let graph = Graph(directed: true) {
    "a" --> "b"
    "a" --> "c"
    ("b" --> "c").constraint(false)
}
```

> **Note**:
> Swift 5.1 may require explicit typecast expressions in order to
> reconcile use of custom edge operators like `-->`.
> (`error: ambiguous reference to member '-->'`)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the GraphViz package to your target dependencies in `Package.swift`:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "YourProject",
  dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/GraphViz",
        from: "0.1.3"
    ),
  ]
)
```

Add `GraphViz` as a dependency to your target(s):

```swift
targets: [
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: ["GraphViz"]),
```

To render graphs to SVG, PNG, and other formats,
you must have GraphViz executables (e.g. `dot`) installed on your system
and accessible from `$PATH`.
You can install GraphViz from the command line:

```terminal
# macOS
$ brew install graphviz

# Linux (Ubuntu)
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
```
